  Ok.  Please make sure that at least two of the papers are published in professional journals and that they have at least some mathematical analyses.  You can then email to me the PDFs and the exact places where they were published for my approval.  Then, I will need cumulative copies of word report and power point slides weekly, by end of each Friday.
